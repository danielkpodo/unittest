# Unit Testing in Python

- Testing enables us to refactor our code with confidence
- It also helps catch errors early in our code before it hits production
- Tests written must be really descriptive and readable
- When testing test all cases, expecially both true and false
- Testing should be more focused on breaking our code and how we can fix it
